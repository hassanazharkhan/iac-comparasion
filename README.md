# Comparing Pulumi, Terraform, and AWS CDK: A Detailed Analysis

## Pulumi

Pulumi is a versatile and modern IaC tool that supports all major cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Cloudflare. Additionally, it extends support to SaaS vendors like MongoDB Atlas and has first-class Kubernetes support. Pulumi also caters to private and hybrid clouds, making it a comprehensive solution for various cloud environments.

  

### Key Features

  

*   **Multi-Language Support**: Pulumi supports more programming languages than its alternatives, allowing developers to use languages they are already familiar with.
*   **Open Source**: Pulumi is open source, fostering a community-driven development model.
*   **Pulumi Cloud Integration**: Enhances user experience with features such as state management and collaboration tools.
*   **Ease of Use**: Pulumi offers an easy-to-follow getting started guide, and no classes or 'this' references are required.

  

### Performance

  

*   **Initial Deployment**: 33 seconds
*   **Subsequent Deployment (after Lambda change)**: 18 seconds

  

### Other Considerations

  

*   **State Management**: Uses backend state, defaulting to Pulumi Cloud, but can also be self-managed.
*   **Code Lines**: 122 lines to write the deployment code.
*   **Modular Nature**: Requires downloading multiple binaries, each containing code for different languages and cloud resources.
*   **Local Login**: An extra step is needed to use local login as Pulumi defaults to registering on Pulumi Cloud by default.
*   **CDK Constructs:** There is support for running CDK constructs on pulumi. But its still in preview even after two years its announcement.

  

## Terraform

  

Terraform by HashiCorp is a widely adopted IaC tool known for its robust multi-cloud support. However, it comes with its own set of challenges, particularly related to its domain-specific language, HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

  

### Key Features

  

*   **HCL Language**: Requires learning HCL, which can be verbose and limiting compared to general-purpose programming languages.
*   **Multi-Cloud Support**: Like Pulumi, Terraform supports multiple cloud providers.
*   **Editor Experience**: The editor experience is not as smooth as its alternatives, making it less developer-friendly.
*   **CDKTF**: Allows using CDK with Terraform, translating templates to Terraform configurations. However, this feature is still in early development and has not reached version 1.0.

  

### Performance

  

*   **Initial Deployment**: 65 seconds.
*   **Subsequent Deployment**: 26 seconds

  

### Other Considerations

  

*   **State Management**: Uses local state.
*   **Errors:** Got error on first deployed. It deployed rest of resources without deploying the resource with error. This is unlike CDK which has all or nothing approach.
*   **Code Lines**: 175 lines to write the deployment code.
*   **Complexity**: Managing low-level resources can be cumbersome, as exemplified by the need to define multiple resources for a simple REST API.
*   **License**: Non-open source.

  

## AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)

  

AWS CDK is specifically designed for AWS, offering deep integration and first-party support for AWS services. This tight integration results in several advantages and some limitations.

  

### Key Features

  

*   **Language Support**: Supports fewer languages than Pulumi, but has better integration with TypeScript.
*   **AWS-Specific**: Only supports AWS, which allows for a more streamlined and optimized experience for AWS users.
*   **Constructs**: Provides higher-level constructs that abstract away the complexity of AWS resources, reducing the amount of code developers need to write.

  

### Performance

  

*   **Initial Deployment**: 104 seconds
*   **Subsequent Deployment (after Lambda change)**: 93 seconds
*   **Hotswap:** 19 seconds (should only be used in development)

  

### Other Considerations

  

*   **State Management**: Uses AWS CloudFormation for state tracking.
*   **Code Lines**: 88 lines to write the deployment code.
*   **Verbosity**: Requires passing around stacks and classes, making the code more verbose.

  

## Conclusion

  

*   **AWS CDK**: If you are exclusively working with AWS and can tolerate slower deployment times, CDK is the best choice. It offers deep integration with AWS services and provides higher-level constructs to simplify your infrastructure code.
*   **Pulumi**: For more complex infrastructure needs and if you prefer using general-purpose programming languages, Pulumi is the ideal tool. It supports multiple cloud providers, has quick deployment times, and offers a versatile and developer-friendly experience.
*   **Terraform**: Use Terraform if you need a robust multi-cloud IaC tool and are comfortable with learning and working with HCL. However, be cautious of its non-open source license and the potentially verbose and complex nature of the configurations.
